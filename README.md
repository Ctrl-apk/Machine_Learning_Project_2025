# Machine Learning Project ðŸ§ 

## What the hell is this?

Welcome to my Machine Learning project for this goddamn class! This repository is where I'll be dumping all my ML experiments, models, and probably a lot of frustration as I try to make sense of algorithms that seem to have a mind of their own.

## What we're building

This project is going to be a wild ride through the world of machine learning. We'll be:
- Playing around with datasets (because apparently that's what cool kids do)
- Training models that will probably overfit like crazy
- Trying to make sense of why our accuracy is stuck at 50% (spoiler: it's always the data)
- Debugging code that worked yesterday but decided to break today

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Because apparently we can't escape it
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - For those "let me just try this real quick" moments
- **Pandas** - To wrangle data like a pro (or at least pretend to)
- **Scikit-learn** - The Swiss Army knife of ML (that we'll probably misuse)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** - For when we want to feel fancy
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - To make pretty graphs that hide our terrible results

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Where we store our precious datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/      # Jupyter notebooks (the real MVP)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/           # Actual code (if we ever get there)
â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Trained models that may or may not work
â”œâ”€â”€ results/       # Plots, metrics, and other evidence of our struggles
â””â”€â”€ docs/          # Documentation (because we're responsible adults)
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (if you're brave enough)
2. Set up your virtual environment (seriously, do it)
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Pray to the ML gods that everything works
5. Start coding and hope for the best

## Current Status

- [ ] Project setup
- [ ] Data collection (the fun part)
- [ ] Data preprocessing (the not-so-fun part)
- [ ] Model training (the "why is this taking forever" part)
- [ ] Evaluation (the "oh shit, it's not working" part)
- [ ] Documentation (the "I'll do it later" part)

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this mess, feel free to:
- Open an issue (preferably with lots of details about what's broken)
- Submit a pull request (but please test it first, for the love of god)
- Share your own ML horror stories
